## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `jspdf`: PDF generation library
- `html2canvas`: HTML-to-image conversion for PDF creation

### Image Handling (UPDATED)
- **NEW**: Images converted to base64 data URLs to eliminate CORS issues completely
- **IMPROVED**: Dual-fallback strategy: Direct fetch â†’ CORS proxy â†’ Placeholder
- **ENHANCED**: Parallel processing of all card images before PDF generation
- Uses Scryfall API card data from scryfall_json with automatic URL construction
- 10-second timeout per image conversion (increased from 8 seconds)
- 30-second overall timeout protection to prevent hanging
- Graceful degradation with "No Image Available" placeholder

### Error Handling
- Network failure tolerance
- Missing card data handling
- File download error recovery
- Progress indicators for PDF generation

## Usage
1. Navigate to any deck in the deck editor
2. Look for the export buttons next to the deck title
3. Click "ðŸ“„ Export Text" for a plain text deck list
4. Click "ðŸ“‘ Export PDF" for a visual deck list with card images

## File Naming
- Text files: `{deck-name}.txt`
- PDF files: `{deck-name}.pdf`
- Defaults to "deck" if no name is set

Both export functions handle all card sections (main deck, sideboard, tech ideas) and preserve card quantities and foil status information.

## Card Price Display Issue Resolution

### Database Analysis:
- The database contains 502,349 total cards
- 95.5% of cards have price information
- 4.5% of cards have no price information (genuinely not available in Scryfall)
- 76.9% of cards have a price of $0.01

### Key Issues Found:
1. Some cards had inconsistent price fields (`prices.usd` vs `scryfall_json.prices.usd`)
2. The frontend wasn't distinguishing between real $0.01 prices and fallback values
3. Some cards didn't have price data in Scryfall at all

### Improvements Made:
1. Fixed inconsistencies between `prices.usd` and `scryfall_json.prices.usd` fields in the database
2. Enhanced the price extraction logic in the frontend:
   - Better prioritization of price sources
   - Improved handling of basic lands and $0.01 prices
   - More comprehensive fallback mechanisms for searching price data
3. Updated the UI display of prices with specific styling for basic lands

### Findings:
1. Syncing database price fields eliminated all inconsistencies
2. Some cards genuinely don't have prices in Scryfall and will correctly show as "N/A"
3. Many cards legitimately have prices of $0.01 in the Scryfall database
4. The frontend now shows "N/A" only when there is truly no price available

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor price display in the UI to ensure it's working correctly
2. Consider a regular price update process using the `sync-all-prices-from-scryfall.cjs` script
3. For truly missing cards (like "Docside Chef"), consider manual fixes or database updates

This solution correctly handles price display without needing to re-upload the entire database.

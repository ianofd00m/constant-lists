# Fix for $31.92 Sphere Grid Pricing Issue

## **Problem**
Cards in tech ideas sometimes show incorrect high prices (like $31.92 for Sphere Grid) due to corrupted cache data.

## **Immediate Fix**
Run this command in the browser console while on the deck edit page:

```javascript
window.clearTechIdeasCache()
```

This will clear all cached pricing data and force the system to recalculate prices from fresh Scryfall data.

## **To Check for Suspicious Prices**
```javascript
window.validateTechIdeasCache()
```

This will show all cached prices over $100 or at $0, which are likely corrupted.

## **What Was Fixed**
1. **Cache Validation**: The cache system now validates prices before storing or retrieving them
2. **Price Limits**: Prices over $100 are rejected as suspicious 
3. **Auto-Cleanup**: Corrupted cache entries are automatically deleted
4. **Debug Tools**: Added console functions to manually clear and validate the cache

## **Prevention**
The updated code now prevents corrupted prices from being cached in the first place, so this issue should not occur again for new cards added to tech ideas.

## **How It Happened**
The cache system was designed to prevent corruption but was actually storing corrupted prices and persisting them across page refreshes. The $31.92 price was an old corrupted value that got stuck in the cache.

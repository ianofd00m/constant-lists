# This script is a placeholder for future development work to integrate
# the CardGroupSortOptions component into the DeckViewEdit.jsx sidebar

## Based on our analysis:

1. The CardGroupSortOptions component has been implemented correctly
2. The component is properly defined with the following features:
   - Group by: Card Type, Mana Value, Color Identity, Collection Status
   - Sort by: Name (A-Z), Name (Z-A), Price ($-$$$), Price ($$$-$)
3. The grouping and sorting functions are implemented and work correctly:
   - groupCardsByType
   - groupCardsByManaValue
   - groupCardsByColorIdentity
   - groupCardsByCollectionStatus
   - sortCards

## Next steps:

1. Find where the sidebar is rendered in the DeckViewEdit.jsx file
2. Add the CardGroupSortOptions component to the sidebar
3. Verify that the component works correctly

## Developer notes:

The CardGroupSortOptions component should be placed under the static preview card
in the sidebar. The component looks like this:

```jsx
<CardGroupSortOptions 
  groupBy={groupBy}
  setGroupBy={setGroupBy}
  sortBy={sortBy}
  setSortBy={setSortBy}
/>
```

Since we haven't been able to locate the exact place in the render method where
the sidebar is defined, a developer will need to identify the right location
and manually add the component.

## Testing:

After adding the component, verify that the grouping and sorting options work
correctly by:
1. Grouping by different criteria (type, mana value, color identity, collection status)
2. Sorting by different criteria (A-Z, Z-A, $-$$$, $$$-$)
3. Ensuring the UI updates correctly when grouping and sorting options are changed

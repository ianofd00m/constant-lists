# Group and Sort Implementation Summary

## Completed Work
- ✅ Implemented all grouping functions
  - groupCardsByType (original function)
  - groupCardsByManaValue (new function)
  - groupCardsByColorIdentity (new function)
  - groupCardsByCollectionStatus (new function)
- ✅ Implemented sorting function (sortCards)
- ✅ Implemented CardGroupSortOptions component
- ✅ Added state management for groupBy and sortBy
- ✅ Updated the useMemo for groupedCards to use the new functions
- ✅ Added detailed documentation and verification scripts

## Remaining Work
- ❌ Add the CardGroupSortOptions component to the UI sidebar
  - The component is defined but not yet used in the UI
  - See docs/group-sort-integration-notes.md for integration guidance
  - Use verify-group-sort-options.js to confirm correct implementation

## Integration Instructions
1. Locate the sidebar render in DeckViewEdit.jsx
2. Add the CardGroupSortOptions component:
   ```jsx
   <CardGroupSortOptions 
     groupBy={groupBy}
     setGroupBy={setGroupBy}
     sortBy={sortBy}
     setSortBy={setSortBy}
   />
   ```
3. Verify the integration works correctly using the verification script

## Testing
After integration, test the following:
- Group by: Card Type (default)
- Group by: Mana Value
- Group by: Color Identity
- Group by: Collection Status
- Sort by: Name A-Z (default)
- Sort by: Name Z-A
- Sort by: Price low to high
- Sort by: Price high to low
